    <h2>Concepts for UMW Social Media Campaign</h2>
  
    <hr class="partial-width skinny white">
  
    <p class="project-desc dark">


        A design excercise built around my alma mater. The theme is based off the University of Mary Washington’s mascot, a bald eagle. The works centered on the idea of “soaring” the way an eagle does and the way a student’s prospects will when they attend the UMW.

    <p class="project-desc dark">The first and most traditional poster in a hypothetical “Soar” campaign for the University of Mary Washington. The wings are a nod to the university’s mascot, an eagle while the wings themselves are a nod to the University’s grey and blue colors. The listed majors are balanced between STEM and Humanities subjects so as to appeal to different students.  </p>
    <p class="project-desc white">The “Soar!” itself aims to create a strong, aspirational, and eye-catching tagline. Visual interest is created with the contrasting directions of the downward-pointing triangle and the upward movement of the wings. </p>
    <p class="project-desc white">This poster, with its heavy focus on text and tall dimensions, fits best for a site like Facebook where image sizes can expand and contain greater information. </p>

    The first post for the social media campaign for the Movie Club. The top and bottom banners act to give enough information without compromising readability or overpowering the central image. Lightly desaturating the image helps to sell the horror film feeling while the gold text helps give the post an eye-catching pop.

      The second movie club post utilized the colors on the cover to create a more complementary effect than the first post. The green and yellow are reflected by the background wallpaper while the font choice was chosen carefully to match the DVD cover. All the elements work together to recreate a 1970’s aesthetic.

      A mock-up for a Recommendation Card for Café Table Toppers. The aim of the piece was to act as a complement to BN’s renewed emphasis on bookseller recommendations as well as utilize a space that is high in customer traffic but low in book sales.
     </p>
     <p class="project-desc white">Designed for a 4×6 card, the text is meant to be fairly short and attention-grabbing. “Bookseller Pick!” is in the largest font and boldest color to get a customer’s attention while the quoted text is meant to be short and enticing enough to make the customer consider finding the book. </p>

      A back side has been designed as well to give the customer a better sense of if they will enjoy the book. The “Recommended by Bookseller” text and portrait are meant to create a stronger relationship between the customer and the bookseller. By giving a list of genres and a sense of the bookseller’s taste customers would seek out booksellers for additional recommendations and thus additional sales.
     </p>
     <p class="project-desc dark">A faded Barnes and Noble Logo strengthens brand identity and creates visual interest without overwhelming the text. Shadows underly the text to keep visual interest and a sense of depth. </p>

      A mock-up for a “Book Bundle Basket” that sought to maximize Barnes and Noble’s extensive inventory of products via a premium gift display.
     </p>
     <p class="project-desc white">Each basket would be organized around a book or a theme, for example, Agatha Christie’s Death on the Nile. The basket includes the book, its film adaptation, an Agatha Christie-themed game, a bookmark of the globe that recalls the period of the piece, and finally the favored drink of Hercules Poirot, Hot Chocolate. </p>
